    Abstract class vs interface: both are used for achieving abstraction
							 both can not be instantiated
							 both are meant to be inherited
							 both can not be final



						 abstract class: one class can extends one abstract class ONLY

						 				instance & statics both are supported

						 				constructor

						 				4 access modifiers are supported


						 interface: one class can implement multiple interfaces


	      Abstract Class:

	        - can not be instantiated
	        - multiple inheritance is not allowed
	        - can have constructor
	        - can have instance, static, and abstract methods
	        - can have instance and static variables
	        - can not be final
	        - can use other access modifiers than public


	      Interface :

	        - can not be instantiated
	        - multiple inheritance is allowed
	        - can not have constructor
	        - can have static , abstract and default methods
	        - can only have static variable(final by default)
	        - can not be final
	        - can not use the access modifiers other than public & private (for static methods)
