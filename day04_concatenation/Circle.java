4. Create a class named Circle and declare the following variables:
				radius
				area
				perimeter

	4.1 Write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with any given radius
			Ex:
			      radius = 5

			output:
			       Area of the square is 78.5
			       Perimeter of the square is 31.4
