					1. salaryBeforeTax
					2. stateTax
					3. federalTax
					4. totalTax
					5. salaryAfterTax
				Hint: salaryBeforeTax = hourlyRate * weeklyHour * 52

			1.3 use print statement to print each of the above
					Ex:	   hourlyRate = $50
						   weeklyHours = 45
						   stateTaxRate = 6 (given as percentage, you need to convert to decimal)
						   federalTaxRate = 26 (given as percentage, you need to convert to decimal)
